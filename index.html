		<p>Hello everyone, my name is Annaëlle and I am an ESSEC student. I was born in France in 2001 and have lived near Paris my entire life. I had the opportunity to travel a lot and discover the world... which became one of my passions ! Another passion of mine is cooking. I love baking birthday cakes, cooking foreign dishes and testing new recipes😋  During the holidays, I like to take care of children as a camp counselor.    		</p>

	<h2> ✈️ Traveling ✈️</h2>
	<p>
I have visited many different countries in Asia, America, Europe and Africa. I love taking pictures when I travel, to be able to share my memories with my family and friends. You can check my Instagram account (via the link down below) to see a few of these pictures !

	<h2>🧁 Cooking 🧁</h2>
	<p>
I started cooking when I was a kid, with my mother. I used to bake a lot with her and then learnt how to cook savoury dishes. Each time I travel in a new country, I like to learn at least one local recipe. My absolute favourite dish is Gosh Tika Massala. It's an Indian dish with lamb, vegetables and delicious spices. I love baking birthday cakes for my sister and my friends 🍰

	<h2>👧 Camp Counseling 👦</h2>
	<p>
As I love children and I am very friendly, I decided to become a camp counselor a few years ago. I like organizing games, sport tournaments, artistic activities, cooking lessons... I love how the kids I take care of are creative, funny and ask interesting questions...
